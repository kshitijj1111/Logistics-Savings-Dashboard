# Freight Logistics Savings Dashboard 📦🚚

## Overview
This project is a **Freight Logistics Savings Dashboard** developed using **Microsoft Excel** and **Microsoft Power BI**.  
It provides end-to-end visibility into freight spend, savings, and logistics efficiency across multiple dimensions such as origin, transporter, truck type, and time period.

The dashboard helps stakeholders:
- Compare baseline vs actual freight spend
- Track overall savings and savings percentage
- Analyze logistics performance by origin, transporter, and vehicle type
- Make informed, data-driven cost optimization decisions

The solution includes **Primary** and **Secondary** dashboards for both summary-level and detailed analysis.
