# Freight Logistics Savings Dashboard 📦🚚

## Overview
This project is a **Freight Logistics Savings Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of logistics spend, savings, and operational efficiency across multiple dimensions such as origin, transporter, truck type, and time period.

The objective of this dashboard is to help stakeholders:
- Track baseline vs actual freight spend
- Identify savings (or cost overruns)
- Analyze performance by origin, transporter, and vehicle type
- Support data-driven logistics and cost-optimization decisions

The dashboard consists of **Primary** and **Secondary** views to allow both high-level and granular analysis :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
